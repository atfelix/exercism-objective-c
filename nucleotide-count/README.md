# Nucleotide Count

Given a single stranded DNA string, compute how many times each nucleotide occurs in the string.

The genetic language of every living thing on the planet is DNA.
DNA is a large molecule that is built from an extremely long sequence of individual elements called nucleotides.
4 types exist in DNA and these differ only slightly and can be represented as the following symbols: 'A' for adenine, 'C' for cytosine, 'G' for guanine, and 'T' thymine.

Here is an analogy:
- twigs are to birds nests as
- nucleotides are to DNA as
- legos are to lego houses as
- words are to sentences as...

## Setup

There are two different methods of getting set up to run the tests with Objective-C:

- Create an Xcode project with a test target which will run the tests.
- Use the ruby gem `objc` as a test runner utility.

Both are described in more detail here: http://exercism.io/languages/objective-c

### Submitting Exercises

When submitting an exercise, make sure your solution file is in the same directory as the test code.

The submit command will look something like:

```shell
exercism submit <path-to-exercism-workspace>/objective-c/nucleotide-count/NucleotideCount.m
```

You can find the Exercism workspace by running `exercism debug` and looking for the line beginning
with Workspace.

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
